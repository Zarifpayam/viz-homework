The greatest chart for interpreting my data is Transaction volume versus price. It shows a positive correlation and thus it means where there is more volume of bitcoin transaction, the price is higher. 
I am still exploring this dataset. Frankly, its very hard to forsee the direction of the price of bitcoin. However, I am using this dataset to find some broad relationships. 
there are cautions to be taken when analyzing bitcoin data e.g. some measures can never be exact. What i will be interested is seeihg how price moves with respect to various measures. to do that, I would need to do a multiple regression
